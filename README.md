# Elementor Paywall

This is a quick plugin I made for a client that wanted to restrict certain posts to those that have bought a corresponding product.

This adds an extra settings page to the admin dashboard that allows you to link products to posts.

The plugin is very much in early stages and therefore there are bound to be bugs, and is provided as is. No support is provided, however if you create an issue, I will look into it and push a fix when able, or if you want to contribute a bug fix, don't hessitate to create a pull request
